# Maya Canvas Integration Fix

## Root Cause Analysis

After 100+ failed attempts, the core issues were identified:

### **Problem 1: Canvas Integration Failure**
The `handleCanvasUpdate` function was doing **NOTHING** except logging:
```typescript
const handleCanvasUpdate = (content: any) => {
  // Don't handle canvas updates here - let the proposal editor handle them
  // The proposal editor already has proper extractedContent handling
  console.log('Canvas update triggered:', content);
};
```

### **Problem 2: Generic, Non-Contextual Responses**
Maya was generating generic responses like:
- "My Org" instead of actual organization name
- Generic descriptions that could apply to any grant/organization
- No specific details about what was actually created

### **Problem 3: Chat Message Alignment**
User messages were awkwardly aligned due to CSS flex issues.

## Fixes Applied

### **1. Fixed Canvas Content Insertion**
```typescript
const handleCanvasUpdate = (content: any) => {
  if (!editor || !content || !content.content) {
    console.log('Canvas update failed: missing editor or content', { editor: !!editor, content });
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    // Actually insert Maya's generated content into the Tiptap editor
    editor.commands.setContent(content.content);
    console.log('Canvas updated successfully with Maya content');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to update canvas:', error);
  }
};
```

**This was the main issue** - Maya was generating content correctly, but it was never being inserted into the canvas editor.

### **2. Enhanced Prompt for Contextual Responses**
Updated the prompt to require:
- Use ACTUAL organization name, grant title, funder name
- Mention SPECIFIC funding amounts and timelines
- Reference ACTUAL organizational strengths from context
- Explain WHY specific strategic choices were made
- Describe CONCRETE elements built, not generic "sections"
- NEVER use generic placeholders like "My Org"

### **3. Fixed Chat Message Alignment**
```typescript
// Before (awkward alignment)
<div className={`flex items-start space-x-2 max-w-[80%] ${message.role === 'user' ? 'flex-row-reverse space-x-reverse' : ''}`}>

// After (proper alignment)
<div className={`flex items-start max-w-[80%] ${message.role === 'user' ? 'flex-row-reverse space-x-reverse space-x-2' : 'space-x-2'}`}>
```

## Expected Results

### **Canvas Integration**
- Maya's generated content will now actually appear in the canvas
- No more empty pages when content is generated
- Proper A4 page structure with content flowing naturally

### **Contextual Responses**
Instead of generic responses, Maya will now provide specific details like:
```
"Here's what I created for [Actual Org Name]'s $2.5M application to the Gates Foundation:

• Built a comprehensive malaria prevention program targeting 15,000 rural families in Kenya
• Leveraged your organization's 8-year track record in community health education 
• Structured the budget around your existing partnerships with 12 local clinics
• Emphasized your team's expertise in mobile health technology
• Created a 36-month timeline that aligns with the funder's preference for multi-year commitments
• Highlighted your previous success with the WHO collaboration as proof of capacity"
```

### **UI Improvements**
- Proper chat message alignment
- Better visual flow in conversations
- Professional appearance

## Technical Details

### **The Core Issue**
The problem was **NOT in the AI layer** - Maya was generating content correctly. The issue was in the **frontend integration** where:
1. Generated content was never inserted into the editor
2. Responses were not using the rich context data available
3. CSS alignment was causing visual issues

### **Files Modified**
- `src/components/canvas-aware-maya-chat.tsx` - Fixed canvas update handler and message alignment
- `src/app/api/maya/route.ts` - Enhanced prompts for contextual responses (already had improvements)

### **Key Learnings**
- Always verify the complete data flow from API to UI
- Generic responses indicate the AI isn't using available context data
- Frontend integration issues can mask AI capabilities

This fix addresses the fundamental canvas integration problem that has persisted for weeks, ensuring Maya's generated content actually appears in the canvas and provides meaningful, contextual feedback to users.
