# Grant Scraping System Status

## üö® **CRITICAL: NO PLACEHOLDER DATA POLICY**

**This system is configured to NEVER store fake, sample, or placeholder grant data in the database.**

All scrapers will either:
- ‚úÖ Extract real, verified grant data from actual sources
- ‚ùå Return empty results (no grants stored)

## üìä **Current Implementation Status**

### Scraping Sources Configuration
All sources are currently set to `INACTIVE` status until real scraping is implemented:

| Source | Status | Implementation Status |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| Gates Foundation | `INACTIVE` | ‚ùå Needs real HTML parsing |
| Grants.gov | `INACTIVE` | ‚ùå Needs API integration |
| Ford Foundation | `INACTIVE` | ‚ùå Needs real HTML parsing |
| Rockefeller Foundation | `INACTIVE` | ‚ùå Needs real HTML parsing |
| GlobalGiving | `INACTIVE` | ‚ùå Needs real HTML parsing |

### What Happens When You Click "Trigger"
1. **System Response**: "Started 0 scraping jobs" (because all sources are INACTIVE)
2. **Database Impact**: No grants will be created
3. **Job Status**: Jobs may be created but will find 0 grants
4. **Data Integrity**: ‚úÖ Maintained - no fake data stored

## üîß **Next Steps for Real Data**

### Option 1: Implement Real Website Scraping
1. **Inspect actual website HTML** for each source
2. **Update CSS selectors** to match real website structure  
3. **Handle anti-bot protection** (rate limiting, headers, etc.)
4. **Test with real websites** to ensure data extraction works
5. **Set sources to ACTIVE** only after verification

### Option 2: Use Official APIs
1. **Grants.gov**: Implement their REST API
2. **Foundation APIs**: Check if foundations provide APIs
3. **Structured data**: Look for JSON-LD or other structured data

### Option 3: Manual Data Entry (Temporary)
1. **Admin interface** for manually adding verified grants
2. **Data validation** to ensure quality
3. **Source attribution** to track data origin

## üéØ **Recommended Immediate Action**

1. **Choose one source** (e.g., Grants.gov API)
2. **Implement real data extraction** for that source only
3. **Test thoroughly** with real data
4. **Set that source to ACTIVE** once verified
5. **Gradually expand** to other sources

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current System Behavior**

- **Trigger buttons work** but find no active sources
- **No fake grants** will be created
- **System is ready** for real implementation
- **Database integrity** is maintained

This approach ensures we never compromise data quality while building toward real functionality.
