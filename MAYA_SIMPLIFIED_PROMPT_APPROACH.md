# Maya Simplified Prompt Approach

## Overview
Removed over-engineered examples and instead provided clear structural guidance that trusts Grok-4's natural intelligence to generate appropriate responses.

## Key Philosophy Change

### Before: Over-Engineered Examples
- Provided specific formatted examples with emojis and exact structure
- Constrained the LLM with rigid templates
- Risked misleading the model with overly prescriptive patterns

### After: Trust-Based Structural Guidance
- Removed all specific examples
- Provided clear response structure guidelines
- Trusts Grok-4's intelligence to apply the structure naturally
- Allows for more authentic and contextually appropriate responses

## New Response Structure

### Chat Response Structure
```
CHAT RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
- FIRST TWO LINES: Acknowledge user prompt warmly, show you're walking with them in their quest
- MIDDLE SECTION: If canvas action taken, summarize what you did comprehensively yet scannably using lists/bullets, explain why you did it
- FINAL SECTION: Suggest next steps or offer specific help like "I can help you expand the budget section" or "Share additional information and I'll show you how to use it" - end with "Just tell me which one to proceed with"
- Use scannable format: bullets, lists, clear structure - avoid long paragraphs
- Be conversational and supportive throughout
```

## What Was Removed

### Specific Examples Removed
- `budgetExample` with rigid emoji and formatting patterns
- `adviceExample` with prescribed structure
- `completeProposalExample` with exact wording
- All template variables and placeholder interpolation

### What Remains
- Clear structural guidance
- Document formatting requirements for canvas content
- A4 page structure rules
- Professional table requirements
- Response flow guidance

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Natural Intelligence Utilization
- Leverages Grok-4's natural language understanding
- Allows for contextually appropriate responses
- Reduces risk of template-driven responses

### 2. Authentic Interactions
- Maya can respond more naturally to user context
- Responses feel more conversational and less robotic
- Better adaptation to different user communication styles

### 3. Reduced Prompt Bloat
- Significantly shorter prompts
- Faster processing and lower token usage
- Less chance of prompt confusion or conflicts

### 4. Flexibility
- Maya can adapt response style to user needs
- Better handling of edge cases and unique situations
- More creative and contextually relevant suggestions

## Response Structure Guidelines

### Acknowledgment (First Two Lines)
- Warm acknowledgment of user request
- Show empathy and partnership in their grant quest
- Set supportive, collaborative tone

### Action Summary (Middle Section)
- If canvas action was taken, explain what was done
- Use scannable format: bullets, lists, clear structure
- Explain the reasoning behind actions
- Comprehensive yet digestible information

### Next Steps (Final Section)
- Offer specific, actionable help
- Examples: "I can help you expand the budget section"
- Examples: "Share additional information and I'll show you how to use it"
- Always end with: "Just tell me which one to proceed with"

## Technical Implementation

### Simplified Prompt Structure
```typescript
CHAT RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
- FIRST TWO LINES: Acknowledge user prompt warmly...
- MIDDLE SECTION: If canvas action taken, summarize...
- FINAL SECTION: Suggest next steps or offer specific help...
- Use scannable format: bullets, lists, clear structure
- Be conversational and supportive throughout

Trust your intelligenceâ€”respond naturally following the structure above
```

### Maintained Requirements
