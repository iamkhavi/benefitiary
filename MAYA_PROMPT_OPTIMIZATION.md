# Maya Prompt Optimization Based on ChatGPT Guide

## Current Issues with Maya Prompt:
1. **Too Long**: ~2000+ lines causing token bloat and slower processing
2. **Rigid Examples**: May cause overfitting to specific phrases
3. **Missing Semantic Reasoning**: Doesn't leverage Grok-4's advanced understanding
4. **No Chain-of-Thought**: Doesn't guide the model to reason step-by-step

## Optimized Approach:

### 1. Semantic Intent Detection
- Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning instead of keyword matching
- Leverage Grok-4's natural language understanding
- Focus on user intent rather than specific phrases

### 2. Diverse Few-Shot Examples
- Cover paraphrase clusters (direct, indirect, implied)
- Include negative examples to sharpen boundaries
- Vary phrasing to teach semantic flexibility

### 3. Modular Prompt Structure
- Base system prompt (~800-1500 tokens total)
- Dynamic context inserts
- Lightweight version for simple chat

### 4. Key Improvements:
- **Persona & Role** (~100 tokens)
- **Semantic Instructions** (~300 tokens) 
- **Few-Shot Examples** (~400 tokens)
- **Dynamic Context** (~200-500 tokens)
- **Output Format** (~100 tokens)

## Implementation Plan:
1. Replace current 2000+ line prompt with ~800-1000 token version
2. Add semantic reasoning instructions
3. Include diverse few-shot examples
4. Test with real user queries
5. Monitor intent classification accuracy

## Expected Benefits:
- **Faster Processing**: 60-70% reduction in prompt tokens
- **Better Intent Detection**: Semantic understanding vs keyword matching
- **More Flexible**: Handles paraphrases and variations
- **Improved UX**: More natural conversations with Maya

This aligns with the ChatGPT guide's recommendations for semantic-focused prompt engineering.
