My Org, a nonprofit based in Kenya, is uniquely positioned to address the critical gap in HIV prevention options for girls and young women in Southern Africa by leveraging our expertise in public health and community-driven initiatives.</p><p><strong>Project Impact:</strong> This initiative will directly benefit over 10,000 girls and young women in Kenya by increasing access to HIV prevention methods, raising awareness, and fostering female leadership in health advocacy. Our community-centered approach ensures sustainable results that extend beyond the funding period.</p><p><strong>Organizational Readiness:</strong> With our established presence in Kenya and expertise in agriculture, climate, public health, and education, we have the infrastructure and partnerships necessary for immediate implementation and long-term success in addressing health challenges.</p><div class=\"page-break\"></div><h1>Statement of Need</h1><p>The challenge of limited access to HIV prevention options for girls and young women in Southern Africa, including Kenya, aligns directly with Aidsfonds's mission under the EmpowHER Fund. Current gaps in awareness, advocacy, and community engagement create significant barriers that our project will systematically address.</p><h2>Problem Definition</h2><p>In Kenya, girls and young women face disproportionately high rates of HIV infection due to limited access to prevention tools, lack of education, and systemic gender inequities. According to UNAIDS, young women aged 15-24 in sub-Saharan Africa are twice as likely to be living with HIV compared to their male counterparts. This urgent need drives our proposed intervention.</p><h2>Target Population</h2><p>Our project targets 10,000 girls and young women aged 15-24 in rural and urban communities in Kenya, focusing on those at high risk due to socio-economic vulnerabilities and limited access to health services.</p><h2>Geographic Focus</h2><p>Kenya, as one of the eligible countries for the EmpowHER Fund, presents both challenges (high HIV prevalence) and opportunities (strong community networks) that our locally-rooted organization is well-positioned to address.</p><div class=\"page-break\"></div><h1>Project Description</h1><p>Our comprehensive approach combines evidence-based HIV prevention strategies with innovative advocacy and community engagement to achieve measurable impact. The project will be implemented over a multi-year timeline with clear phases and deliverables aligned with the EmpowHER Fundâ€™s goals of accelerating access to HIV prevention options and fostering female leadership.</p><h2>Goals and Objectives</h2><ul><li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Increase access to and uptake of HIV prevention methods among 10,000 girls and young women in Kenya within the project timeline, contributing to a 20% reduction in new infections in targeted communities.</li><li><strong>Objective 1:</strong> Conduct awareness campaigns reaching 15,000 individuals within the first 6 months, educating on HIV prevention options and reducing stigma.</li><li><strong>Objective 2:</strong> Train 200 young women as peer leaders and advocates within 12 months to engage with health systems and governments for sustained policy change.</li><li><strong>Objective 3:</strong> Establish 10 community-driven initiatives by the projectâ€™s midpoint to ensure long-term access to prevention tools and support networks for women and girls.</li></ul><h2>Innovation and Approach</h2><p>Our approach integrates feminist principles by centering the voices of girls and young women in program design and implementation, ensuring that interventions are culturally relevant and community-led, a core alignment with the EmpowHER Fundâ€™s mission.</p><div class=\"page-break\"></div><h1>Methodology and Implementation</h1><p>Our methodology employs best practices in public health and gender equity with proven strategies that ensure sustainable impact. We will utilize a multi-phase approach designed to maximize effectiveness and align with Aidsfonds's strategic priorities for HIV prevention.</p><h2>Phase 1: Foundation Building</h2><p>Engage stakeholders, map community needs, and develop tailored educational materials on HIV prevention options, ensuring alignment with local contexts and feminist principles over the first 3 months.</p><h2>Phase 2: Core Implementation</h2><p>Roll out awareness campaigns, peer leadership training, and community initiatives over the subsequent 18 months, focusing on advocacy with health systems and governments to improve access to prevention tools.</p><h2>Phase 3: Evaluation and Sustainability</h2><p>Assess impact, document lessons learned, and transition leadership to community structures in the final 6 months, ensuring long-term ownership and scalability of HIV prevention efforts.</p><div class=\"page-break\"></div><h1>Timeline and Milestones</h1><table style=\"width: 100%;
