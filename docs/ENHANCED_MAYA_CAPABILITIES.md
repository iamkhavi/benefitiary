# Enhanced Maya Capabilities - Critical Analysis & Document Processing

## üß† Critical Analysis Features

### **Automatic Grant-Organization Fit Analysis**

When Maya loads a grant opportunity, she automatically performs critical analysis:

```typescript
// Maya analyzes:
ALIGNMENT SCORE: 7/10 - Good fit with some gaps
STRENGTHS: 
- Strong healthcare experience aligns with funder focus
- Appropriate organizational size for grant amount
- Geographic location matches eligibility

GAPS:
- Limited evidence of research capacity
- No clear partnerships mentioned
- Sustainability plan unclear

RISKS:
- Competition from research institutions
- Tight deadline may limit proposal quality
- Budget may be insufficient for proposed scope

CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
- What research partnerships do you have?
- How will you ensure project sustainability?
- What's your track record with similar projects?
```

### **Proactive Questioning**

Maya doesn't just wait for questions - she identifies gaps and asks for clarification:

```typescript
User: "Write me a project description"
Maya: "Before I write your project description, I need strategic details to make it competitive. Based on my analysis, this funder prioritizes measurable health outcomes. I need to know:

1. What specific methodology will you use?
2. Who are your target beneficiaries and how many?
3. What partnerships do you have with healthcare institutions?
4. How will you measure success?
5. What makes your approach innovative?

These details will help me craft a compelling, competitive description that addresses the funder's priorities."
```

## üìÑ Document Processing Capabilities

### **RFP Analysis**
```typescript
User: "I uploaded the RFP, can you analyze it?"
Maya: "I've analyzed the 47-page RFP and identified key insights:

EVALUATION CRITERIA (weighted):
- Innovation (30%) - You're strong here
- Organizational Capacity (25%) - Need more evidence
- Sustainability (20%) - Major gap to address
- Budget Efficiency (15%) - Good fit
- Partnership (10%) - Unclear

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Must demonstrate 3+ years experience (‚úì You have this)
- Requires IRB approval (‚ùå Need to address)
- Mandatory letters of support (‚ùå Missing)

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Emphasize your innovation in the executive summary
2. Provide detailed capacity evidence
3. Develop clear sustainability plan
4. Obtain required letters of support

Questions: Do you have IRB approval process started? Which organizations can provide letters of support?"
```

### **Previous Proposal Analysis**
```typescript
User: "Can you review my previous proposal?"
Maya: "I've analyzed your previous proposal and here's what I found:

STRENGTHS TO REPLICATE:
- Excellent methodology section (pages 15-20)
- Strong budget justification
- Clear timeline with realistic milestones

AREAS THAT LIKELY HURT YOUR CHANCES:
- Weak executive summary (too generic)
- Limited evidence of organizational capacity
- No clear sustainability plan
- Missing key partnerships

FOR THIS NEW PROPOSAL:
- Strengthen the executive summary with specific outcomes
- Add organizational capacity evidence
- Include detailed sustainability section
- Highlight new partnerships you've developed

What new partnerships or capacity have you built since the last proposal?"
```

## üéØ Strategic Positioning

### **Competitive Analysis**
```typescript
Maya: "Based on this grant's history and requirements, you'll be competing against:
- Research universities (advantage: resources, disadvantage: less community connection)
- Large NGOs (advantage: scale, disadvantage: less specialized)
- Government agencies (advantage: authority, disadvantage: bureaucracy)

YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
- Community-embedded approach
- Agile implementation capacity
- Cost-effective operations
- Local partnerships

POSITIONING STRATEGY:
Position as 'community-connected implementation partner' rather than 'research institution.' Emphasize practical outcomes over academic research."
```

### **Risk Mitigation**
```typescript
Maya: "I've identified 3 major risks for your application:

RISK 1: Limited research experience
MITIGATION: Partner with university research center

RISK 2: Tight timeline (proposal due in 3 weeks)
MITIGATION: Focus on strongest sections, use templates for standard parts

RISK 3: High competition (200+ expected applications)
MITIGATION: Differentiate through community focus and cost-effectiveness

Should I help you develop partnership agreements or focus on differentiation strategy first?"
```

## üîç Information Gathering

### **Systematic Gap Analysis**
```typescript
Maya: "I've reviewed your profile against grant requirements. Here's what we need to strengthen your application:

MISSING INFORMATION (Critical):
- Specific project methodology
- Target population size and demographics
- Key performance indicators
- Organizational chart and staff qualifications
- Letters of support from partners
- Detailed budget breakdown

WEAK AREAS (Important):
- Sustainability planning
- Risk management strategy
- Evaluation methodology
- Dissemination plan

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. What specific methodology will you use? (Critical for technical review)
2. How many people will you serve? (Required for impact calculation)
3. Which organizations have committed to partner? (Affects feasibility score)
4. What's your plan for continuing after grant ends? (Sustainability requirement)

Let's tackle these systematically. Which area should we address first?"
```

## üìä Real-Time Analysis Examples

### **Budget Analysis**
```typescript
User: "Is my budget realistic?"
Maya: "I've analyzed your budget against similar grants and funder expectations:

BUDGET ANALYSIS:
- Total: $85,000 (within range ‚úì)
- Personnel: 65% (appropriate for service grants ‚úì)
- Indirect: 15% (higher than funder prefers ‚ùå)
- Equipment: 5% (low for tech project ‚ùå)

FUNDER PREFERENCES (based on previous awards):
- Prefers 10% indirect costs
- Expects 15-20% equipment for tech projects
- Values cost-sharing (you have 0%)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Reduce indirect to 10% ($7,500 savings)
2. Increase equipment budget to $15,000
3. Add $7,500 cost-sharing commitment

This positions you as cost-conscious while meeting technical requirements. Can your organization commit to cost-sharing?"
```

### **Timeline Feasibility**
```typescript
User: "Is my timeline realistic?"
Maya: "I've analyzed your 18-month timeline against project complexity:

TIMELINE ANALYSIS:
- Months 1-3: Setup (realistic ‚úì)
- Months 4-12: Implementation (aggressive ‚ùå)
- Months 13-18: Evaluation (too short ‚ùå)

RED FLAGS:
- 8 months for implementation is tight for community engagement
- 6 months evaluation insufficient for longitudinal outcomes
- No buffer time for delays

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Extend implementation to 10 months
2. Start evaluation in month 10 (concurrent)
3. Add 2-month buffer for delays
4. Consider 24-month timeline if funder allows

Based on similar projects, 18 months is feasible but risky. Would you prefer a more conservative timeline or aggressive approach with mitigation strategies?"
```

## üé® Enhanced User Experience

### **Conversation Flow**
```
User: "Help me with this grant"
Maya: "I've analyzed your fit with this Pfizer grant - you have a 7/10 alignment score. Strong healthcare experience, but I see gaps in research partnerships. Before we start writing, I need to understand: What research collaborations do you have? This will determine our positioning strategy."

User: "We partner with State University"
Maya: "Excellent! That partnership significantly strengthens your application - now you're at 8/10 fit. The university connection addresses the research capacity gap. Let me ask: What specific role will they play? Co-PI? Data analysis? This affects how we structure the team section and budget allocation."

User: "They'll handle data analysis and evaluation"
Maya: "Perfect positioning! Now I can write a compelling proposal that positions you as the community implementation leader with university research support. This addresses both community connection AND research rigor - exactly what Pfizer values. Ready to start with the executive summary?"
```

This enhanced Maya is proactive, analytical, and truly consultative - not just a content generator, but a strategic partner in grant success.
