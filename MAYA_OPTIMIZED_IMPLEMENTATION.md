# Maya Optimized Implementation

## Key Principles:
1. **Trust Grok-4's Native Capabilities** - Don't over-engineer
2. **Smart Conversation Management** - Build context intelligently  
3. **Canvas Awareness** - Maya knows what's on canvas and references it
4. **Natural Flow** - Conversations feel continuous and progressive

## Conversation Context Management:

### Smart History Processing:
- Extract themes from recent exchanges (budget, timeline, team, etc.)
- Track canvas progress (empty → draft → polished)
- Reference previous work naturally
- Maintain conversation momentum

### Canvas Intelligence:
- Empty canvas → create new content
- Has content + "improve" → modify existing
- Has content + "create" → add new sections
- Always reference what's already there

## Maya's Conversation Style:
- Build on previous exchanges naturally
- Reference what you've already discussed/created
- Acknowledge user's progress and momentum
- Ask targeted follow-up questions
- Maintain enthusiasm while being strategic

This creates a Maya that feels like a real consultant who remembers your conversation and builds on your work together.
