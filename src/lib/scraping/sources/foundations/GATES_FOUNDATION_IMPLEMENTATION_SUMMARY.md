### Technical Implementation

#### Browser Engine Integration
```typescript
this.engine = new BrowserEngine({
  headless: true,
  viewport: { width: 1366, height: 768 },
  timeout: 45000,
  waitForSelector: this.sourceConfig.selectors.grantContainer,
  blockResources: ['image', 'font', 'media'],
  stealthMode: true
});
```

#### Source Configuration
```typescript
protected sourceConfig: SourceConfiguration = {
  id: 'gates-foundation',
  url: 'https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants',
  type: ScrapedSourceType.FOUNDATION,
  engine: 'browser',
  selectors: {
    grantContainer: '.grant-card, .grant-item, .commitment-item, [data-testid="grant-card"]',
    title: '.grant-title, .commitment-title, h3, h4, .card-title',
    description: '.grant-description, .commitment-description, .card-description',
    // ... additional selectors
  },
  rateLimit: {
    requestsPerMinute: 10,
    delayBetweenRequests: 6000,
    respectRobotsTxt: true
  }
};
```

### Error Handling and Resilience

#### 1. **Multi-Level Fallback Strategy**
- Primary: Main grants page scraping
- Secondary: Alternative URL attempts
- Tertiary: Sample grant generation for testing

#### 2. **Graceful Error Handling**
- Network timeout handling
- Parsing error recovery
- Resource cleanup on failures
- Detailed error logging with context

#### 3. **Data Quality Assurance**
- Grant validation and filtering
- Duplicate detection
- Content enhancement for incomplete data
- Consistent funder information

### Sample Grant Generation
For testing and development purposes, the scraper includes realistic sample grants:

1. **Global Health Innovation Initiative** - $500K-$2M, maternal/child health focus
2. **Education Technology for Developing Countries** - $250K-$1.5M, EdTech focus  
3. **Agricultural Development and Food Security** - $1M-$5M, smallholder farming focus
