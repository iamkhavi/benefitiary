# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Grant Extraction & Management system enables administrators to efficiently input grant information through AI-powered extraction and presents grants through modern, aesthetic cards with comprehensive details. This system leverages OpenAI's API to intelligently parse pasted grant information, extract structured data including funder logos, and create visually appealing grant displays. The system integrates with the existing grant database while providing enhanced admin workflows and improved user experience through beautiful grant cards and detailed grant pages.
