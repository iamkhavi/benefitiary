# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The grant management system currently allows duplicate grants to be saved, which creates data inconsistency and confusion for users. This feature will implement comprehensive duplicate detection and prevention mechanisms to ensure data integrity while providing flexibility for legitimate use cases where similar grants may need to be stored.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the system to automatically detect potential duplicate grants when I try to save a new grant, so that I can avoid creating redundant entries in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to save a grant THEN the system SHALL check for existing grants with matching criteria before saving
2. WHEN duplicate criteria are met THEN the system SHALL prevent automatic saving and display a duplicate warning
3. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL compare grants based on title, funding organization, and application deadline
4. WHEN a potential duplicate is found THEN the system SHALL display the existing grant details for comparison

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see clear information about why a grant is considered a duplicate, so that I can make an informed decision about whether to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a duplicate is detected THEN the system SHALL display the matching criteria that triggered the duplicate detection
2. WHEN showing duplicate information THEN the system SHALL display both the new grant data and existing grant data side by side
3. WHEN displaying duplicate warnings THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific fields that match between grants
4. WHEN a duplicate is found THEN the system SHALL show the creation date and last modified date of the existing grant

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the option to force save a grant even when duplicates are detected, so that I can handle legitimate cases where similar grants need to be stored separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a duplicate is detected THEN the system SHALL provide a "Force Save" option
2. WHEN the user chooses to force save THEN the system SHALL save the grant with a duplicate flag or note
3. WHEN force saving a duplicate THEN the system SHALL log the action for audit purposes
4. WHEN force saving THEN the system SHALL require the user to provide a reason for the override

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to configure the duplicate detection criteria, so that I can customize what constitutes a duplicate based on our organization's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring duplicate detection THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling different matching criteria
2. WHEN setting up criteria THEN the system SHALL support exact match and fuzzy match options for text fields
3. WHEN configuring fuzzy matching THEN the system SHALL allow setting similarity thresholds (e.g., 80% similarity)
4. WHEN criteria are changed THEN the system SHALL apply new rules to future duplicate checks immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to bulk check existing grants for duplicates, so that I can clean up any duplicates that were created before this feature was implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running bulk duplicate detection THEN the system SHALL scan all existing grants for potential duplicates
2. WHEN duplicates are found in bulk scan THEN the system SHALL generate a report listing all duplicate groups
3. WHEN viewing bulk duplicate results THEN the system SHALL allow merging or deleting duplicate entries
4. WHEN processing bulk duplicates THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators for long-running operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want duplicate detection to work efficiently even with large datasets, so that the user experience remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL complete the check within 2 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 grants
2. WHEN the database grows large THEN the system SHALL use database indexing to optimize duplicate detection queries
3. WHEN performing duplicate checks THEN the system SHALL not block other system operations
4. WHEN duplicate detection takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators to users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see a history of duplicate detection actions, so that I can audit and review past decisions about duplicate grants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a duplicate is detected and handled THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp and user information
2. WHEN viewing duplicate history THEN the system SHALL show all duplicate detection events for a specific grant
3. WHEN accessing audit logs THEN the system SHALL display the reason provided for force-saving duplicates
4. WHEN reviewing history THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, user, and action type
