# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Grant Scraping Implementation system is responsible for automatically collecting real grant opportunities from various funding sources and populating the Benefitiary database with accurate, up-to-date grant information. This system will replace template/mock data with actual grant opportunities from foundations, government agencies, and other funding organizations. The scraping system must be reliable, efficient, and capable of handling different website structures while maintaining data quality and avoiding detection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure and manage grant scraping sources, so that the platform can automatically collect grants from various funding organizations.

1. WHEN scraping foundation websites THEN the system SHALL extract grant titles, descriptions, deadlines, and funding amounts
2. WHEN processing foundation pages THEN the system SHALL identify and extract eligibility criteria and application requirements
3. WHEN scraping foundation grants THEN the system SHALL capture funder information including contact details and website
4. WHEN extracting grant data THEN the system SHALL normalize funding amounts to consistent decimal format
5. WHEN processing foundation content THEN the system SHALL handle both static HTML and JavaScript-rendered content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a grant scraping system, I want to extract grants from government funding portals, so that users can access public sector funding opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping government portals THEN the system SHALL extract grants from sites like Grants.gov and similar platforms
2. WHEN processing government grants THEN the system SHALL capture agency information, CFDA numbers, and program details
3. WHEN extracting government data THEN the system SHALL handle structured data formats like XML feeds and APIs where available
4. WHEN scraping government sites THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and terms of service
5. WHEN processing government grants THEN the system SHALL extract location eligibility and applicant type restrictions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a grant scraping system, I want to detect and handle changes in grant information, so that the database remains accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN re-scraping existing grants THEN the system SHALL detect changes using content hashing
2. WHEN grant information changes THEN the system SHALL update existing records rather than creating duplicates
3. WHEN grants are no longer available THEN the system SHALL mark them as expired or closed
4. WHEN deadline changes are detected THEN the system SHALL update deadline information and trigger notifications
5. WHEN significant changes occur THEN the system SHALL log change details for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a grant scraping system, I want to classify and tag grants automatically, so that users receive accurate matching recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing grant content THEN the system SHALL automatically classify grants into appropriate categories
2. WHEN analyzing grant descriptions THEN the system SHALL extract and apply relevant tags for better searchability
3. WHEN classifying grants THEN the system SHALL use both keyword matching and AI-powered content analysis
4. WHEN tagging grants THEN the system SHALL identify location eligibility, organization types, and funding focus areas
5. WHEN classification is uncertain THEN the system SHALL flag grants for manual review with confidence scores

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a grant scraping system, I want to handle errors and failures gracefully, so that the scraping process remains reliable and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with other sources
2. WHEN a source becomes temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL save raw content for manual review and debugging
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL respect limits and reschedule scraping appropriately
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications to administrators with error details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a grant scraping system, I want to maintain scraping performance and efficiency, so that the system can scale to handle multiple sources without impacting platform performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping multiple sources THEN the system SHALL process sources concurrently with configurable parallelism
2. WHEN processing large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL use batch operations for database insertions and updates
3. WHEN scraping frequently THEN the system SHALL implement caching to avoid unnecessary re-processing
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-value sources and recent deadlines
5. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and processing statistics

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a grant scraping system, I want to respect website policies and avoid detection, so that scraping can continue long-term without being blocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing websites THEN the system SHALL use rotating user agents and implement random delays
2. WHEN scraping frequently THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt files and implement appropriate rate limiting
3. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL use proxy rotation and session management to avoid IP blocking
4. WHEN detected as a bot THEN the system SHALL implement CAPTCHA solving or fallback to manual intervention
5. WHEN scraping sensitive sites THEN the system SHALL implement stealth browsing techniques and header randomization

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want to validate and clean scraped grant data, so that users receive accurate and consistent information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing scraped data THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and data formats
2. WHEN extracting funding amounts THEN the system SHALL normalize currency formats and handle ranges appropriately
3. WHEN processing dates THEN the system SHALL parse various date formats and validate deadline logic
4. WHEN cleaning text content THEN the system SHALL remove HTML artifacts and normalize whitespace
5. WHEN data quality is poor THEN the system SHALL flag grants for manual review with quality scores

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor scraping operations and performance, so that I can ensure the system operates effectively and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping runs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates and progress indicators
2. WHEN scraping completes THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with statistics and success rates
3. WHEN monitoring scraping THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics like processing time and success rates
4. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide alerting and notification systems for administrators
5. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL maintain historical data for trend analysis and optimization

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a grant scraping system, I want to handle different website architectures and content types, so that I can extract grants from diverse funding sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria
