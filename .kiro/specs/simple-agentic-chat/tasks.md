  - Implement database query tool for accessing grants and organization data
  - Add conversation memory using simple message history array
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 1.1 Implement Expert Persona System
  - Create Maya Chen persona prompt with grant expertise and conversational tone
  - Build context-aware prompt generation using organization and grant data
  - Implement response validation to ensure expert-level advice quality
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 1.2 Add Database Integration Tool
  - Create database query tool that agent can use to fetch grant and organization information
  - Implement efficient data loading for user organization profile and grant details
  - Add query optimization to minimize database calls during conversation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 2. Build Simple Chat API
  - Create clean API endpoint at /api/ai/chat that handles user messages
  - Implement session management for conversation continuity
  - Add proper error handling with graceful fallbacks
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 2.1 Implement Conversation Memory
  - Build simple conversation state management using message history
  - Add session persistence to database for conversation continuity
  - Implement memory optimization to maintain context within token limits
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 2.2 Add Context Loading System
  - Create efficient context assembly that loads organization and grant data once per session
  - Implement context optimization to include relevant information in AI prompts
  - Add context validation to ensure data accuracy and completeness
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Replace Existing Complex System
  - Remove over-engineered AI modules (context-assembly, response-generation, strategic-analysis, etc.)
  - Replace complex API route with simple, working implementation
  - Clean up type definitions and remove duplicate/conflicting types
  - _Requirements: All requirements through simplified implementation_

- [ ] 3.1 Clean Up Codebase
  - Delete unnecessary AI system files and complex abstractions
  - Remove conflicting type definitions that prevent successful builds
  - Simplify imports and dependencies to only what's needed
  - _Requirements: System maintainability and build success_

- [ ] 3.2 Implement New Simple API Route
  - Replace existing complex /api/ai/chat/route.ts with clean, simple implementation
  - Add proper authentication and input validation
  - Implement streaming responses for better user experience
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 4. Testing and Validation
  - Test complete system with real user conversations across different organization types
  - Validate response quality and expert-level advice accuracy
  - Test conversation memory and context retention
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, 4.4_

- [ ] 4.1 Expert Response Quality Testing
  - Validate that AI responses demonstrate grant expertise and provide actionable advice
  - Test personalization based on organization type and grant requirements
  - Ensure conversational tone without robotic template responses
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4.2 System Integration Testing
  - Test database integration and data accuracy in AI responses
  - Validate conversation memory across multiple message exchanges
  - Test error handling and fallback scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_
